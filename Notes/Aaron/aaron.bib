abstract = {In preparing to navigate in an unfamiliar location, a blind person may use non-visual maps. This project is aimed at developing more effective, interactive audio-tactile maps. The maps will be novel in using speech and non-speech sounds and allowing the user to rotate the map, thereby facilitating the building of an egocentric cognitive map. Initial requirements have been gathered from mobility instructors. Their main conclusions are that immoveable objects represent the most useful landmarks and that certain ambient sounds can provide most valuable orientation information.},

abstract = {This paper presents results of an accessibility evaluation carried out with web-based map applications. Three points of view were considered: experts on accessibility, evaluation tools and final users (partially or totally blind people). The document WCAG 2.0 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) provided us with guidelines for evaluation and GQM (Goal, Question and Metric) approach was used to define and set measurable goals. A number of problems was identified and none of the evaluated applications entirely meet the analyzed criteria.},

abstract="Tactile maps can be useful tools for blind people for navigation and orientation tasks. Apart from static maps, there are techniques to augment tactile maps with audio content. They can be used to interact with the map content, to offer extra information and to reduce the tactile complexity of a map. Studies show that audio-tactile maps can be more efficient and satisfying for the user than pure tactile maps without audio feedback. A major challenge of audio-tactile maps is the linkage of tactile elements with audio content and interactivity. This paper introduces a novel approach to link 3D printed tactile maps with mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, in a flexible way to enable interactivity and audio-support. By integrating conductive filaments into the printed maps it seamlessly integrates into the 3D printing process. This allows to automatically recognize the tactile map by a single press at its corner. Additionally, the arrangement of the tactile map on the mobile device is flexible and detected automatically which eases the use of these maps. The practicability of this approach is shown by a dedicated feasibility study.",
