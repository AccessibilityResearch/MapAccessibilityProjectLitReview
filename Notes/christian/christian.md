# Image Accessibility for Screen Reader Users: A Systematic Review and a Road Map

## Citation

[@electronics10080953]

## Overview

@electronics10080953 reviewed 33 papers (using [PRISMA](https://prisma-statement.org) guidelines) with two goals in mind:

1. Understand the current accessibility solutions for screen reader users to "view" images
1. Identify gaps in understanding and suggest a research roadmap

They discovered several things:

-   The types of images, visual information, input devices, and feedback modalities that have been studied to assist in image accessibility on touchscreen devices
-   Very little research has been done on the automation of image-related information
-   Input from target users is _very_ important when designing new accessibility solutions

## Research Questions

_Note: BLV = Blind/Low Vision_

The authors had five questions for their review:

> RQ1. What types of images have been studied for image accessibility?
>
> RQ2. What types of image-related information has been supported for BLV people?
>
> RQ3. How has image-related information been collected?
>
> RQ4. How has image-related information been delivered?
>
> RQ5. How have BLV people been involved in the design and evaluation process?

## Types of Images Studied

Most of the reviewed papers focused on specific types of images. Here were the main three:

| Specific Image Type | Number of Papers |
| :-----------------: | :--------------: |
|        Maps         |        10        |
|       Graphs        |        6         |
|  Geometric Shapes   |        4         |

## Conclusions

The authors came to several conclusions:

1. Image types other than maps, graphs, and geometric shapes are rarely studied
1. Only about 1/3 of the papers provide multi-modal feedback
1. The lack of an automated way to retrieve image-related information is currently an important barrier in making large-scale solutions
1. Studies should get BLV individuals involved early in the process, as their feedback is very important when making design decisions

# Accessible Maps for the Blind: Comparing 3D Printed Models with Tactile Graphics

## Citation

[@10.1145/3173574.3173772]

## Brief Summary

Several studies were done on the effectiveness of Orientation and Mobility (O&M) training for people with blindness and severe vision impairment using 3D models. These studies seem to suggest that 3D models are preferred and more effective than the tactile equivalents for 2D graphics. 3D models can also be enhanced using interactive audio labels.

## MAIN STUDY: COMPARING TACTILE MAPS & 3D PRINTS

-   3D models were preferred

    > Preferred format by map type, as revealed through use (neighbourhood map) or self-reporting (park maps and station plans)
    >
    > |     map      | tactile graphic | both | 3D model |
    > | :----------: | :-------------: | :--: | :------: |
    > | neighborhood |        5        |  2   |    9     |
    > |     park     |        3        |  0   |    13    |
    > |   station    |        4        |  1   |    11    |
