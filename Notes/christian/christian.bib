abstract = {Visits to simulations of real spaces in virtual reality have been proposed as a means for blind people to gain spatial knowledge regarding the disposition of obstacles within a place before actually visiting it. Within the present study, different configurations of distant and proximity exploration were compared to each other, in order to test whether differences in effectiveness and efficiency lead to changes in exploration behaviour, without a detrimental impact on cognitive-map quality and usefulness. Evidence supports effectiveness improvements due to distant exploration (p-value = 0.0006). The flat-spotlight distant-configuration entails a 53% reduction in discovery time (p-value = 0.0027). A trend is observed entailing a 38% reduction in the duration of the overall exploration stage for a flat spotlight configuration (p-value = 0.067). Wall-detection effectiveness alters exploration duration (p-value = 0.012). Improvements in effectiveness and discovery time are associated with shorter overall exploration time. Duration of exploration after discovery time depends on wall-detection effectiveness. Benefits from a distant exploration configuration are not enough to build better cognitive maps.}

ABSTRACT = {A number of studies have been conducted to improve the accessibility of images using touchscreen devices for screen reader users. In this study, we conducted a systematic review of 33 papers to get a holistic understanding of existing approaches and to suggest a research road map given identified gaps. As a result, we identified types of images, visual information, input device and feedback modalities that were studied for improving image accessibility using touchscreen devices. Findings also revealed that there is little study how the generation of image-related information can be automated. Moreover, we confirmed that the involvement of screen reader users is mostly limited to evaluations, while input from target users during the design process is particularly important for the development of assistive technologies. Then we introduce two of our recent studies on the accessibility of artwork and comics, AccessArt and AccessComics, respectively. Based on the identified key challenges, we suggest a research agenda for improving image accessibility for screen reader users.},

abstract = {Tactile maps are widely used in Orientation and Mobility (O&amp;M) training for people with blindness and severe vision impairment. Commodity 3D printers now offer an alternative way to present accessible graphics, however it is unclear if 3D models offer advantages over tactile equivalents for 2D graphics such as maps. In a controlled study with 16 touch readers, we found that 3D models were preferred, enabled the use of more easily understood icons, facilitated better short term recall and allowed relative height of map elements to be more easily understood. Analysis of hand movements revealed the use of novel strategies for systematic scanning of the 3D model and gaining an overview of the map. Finally, we explored how 3D printed maps can be augmented with interactive audio labels, replacing less practical braille labels. Our findings suggest that 3D printed maps do indeed offer advantages for O&amp;M training.},
