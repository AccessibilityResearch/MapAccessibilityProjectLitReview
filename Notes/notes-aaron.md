# Visual Impairments and Mobile Touchscreen Interaction: State-Of-The-Art, Causes of Visual Impairment, and Design Guidelines

## Citation

[@doi:10.1080/10447318.2017.1279827]

## Background

This was an in depth look into what potential problems and solutions can arise from mobile touch screen interactions when used by people with visual impairments.
Along with the latter statement this paper also had a very in depth looks into causes of visual impairment. This portion of the paper does not pertain to us.

## Study

The portion of the paper we are making use of includes the summary of the design guidlines put forth by other (referenced) papers. No testing or surveys were done in this portion of the paper, it is simply a summation of previous guidelines.

## Results

The guideline summation is as stated:

> - Allow configurable visual settings. (studies show people with vis impairment will spend alot of time configuring settings)
 
> - Design for commercially-available wearable devices.
 
> - Design mobile device interactions to reduce encumbrance when using other accessibility devices
 
> - Detect and deal appropriately with unintended touch (possibly a toggle for touch)
 
> - Design usable touch gestures for people with visual impairments (favor landmarks of the device)
 
> - Deliver appropriate feedback for all visual abilities.
 
> - Deliver appropriate feedback during and after gesture articulation


## Questions

1. What does appropriate feedback look like in our case?

# Facilitating Route Learning Using Interactive Audio-Tactile Maps for Blind and Visually Impaired People
## Citation

[@10.1145/2468356.2468364]

## Introduction
This paper covers the information needed to develop a route for the visually impaired. This paper also aims to answer which are the most important landmarks and sounds to include in the route design.


## Study
The authors of the paper conducted a survey of 15 different mobility and orientation instructors. From the paper:
> An online survey study
The aim of the online survey study was to build on the
information obtained from the mobility instructor by
surveying others in the profession. The questionnaire
concentrated on detailed information of the type of
auditory features and landmarks they feel important in
guiding people with visual disabilities in route learning.


## Conclusion

From their results stated in the paper:

- All instructors serveyed claimed the use of landmarks and audio queues was optimal for developing a route.
- All instructors besides 1 developed their own maps.
- All instructors claimed that the use of landmarks that are immovable and permanent such as buildings and intersections where optimal.
- Ambient sounds such as running water, sounds from ground textures, and vehicle sounds are all important.
- Sound from ground textures ranked #1 most important sound for route development.
- Intersections and buildings ranked as the most important landmarks for route development.

## Lessons Learned

-Ambient sound should not be overlooked.
-Intersections are very important as well as traffic.
-Landmarks should be immovable and permanent.
