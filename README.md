## Usage

### Required

Download Git. Link can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

With Git installed, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mrjk1212/MapAccessibilityProject.git
```

This will clone the repo into the current directory.

### Optional

Git usually asks you to setup a **GitHub** account, but in case you don't have one, setting one up at [github.com](https://github.com) is well worth it. It will let you clone and manage your repos using a great user interface.

**VSCode** is a great tool to use with this repo. You can install it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com). There are recommended VSCode extensions that make the files easy to use. You will be prompted to install these recommended extensions when you open the project in VSCode. Refer to their documentation for usage instructions.
