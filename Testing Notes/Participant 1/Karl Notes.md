# Notes on experiment
- Add preferred pronouns to the pretest questionnaire
- Add a question about level of blindness/visual impairment
- Adjust floor color to make the environment easier to see when exposure isn't correct

# Notes during experiment

## Pretest
- N/A

## Level 1 (tutorial 1)
- Initially, it appeared that she was having a difficult time navigating to the first goal. She took a few minutes to get to the first goal, but then managed to navigate to the second goal in less than a minute.

## Level 2 (tutorial 2)
- It took her not very long at all to navigate to the first goal
- She finished in about a minute

## Level 3 (tutorial 3)
- When encountering several pillars in nearby locations, it appeared like she was unsure on what direction to go, opting to avoid all sounds but the sounds of the goals at any time

## Level 4 (Trial 1)
- completed the level with no issue (that I noticed)

## Level 5 (Trial 2)
- Narrowly missed a ball at the outset
- Also narrowly missed a goal, she walked on both sides of it
- She hit the wall while trying to navigate and continued to run into it for a few seconds, before making her way to a goal and completing it
- With one level left, she couldn't hear any clicks left
    - "I hear the moving objects, but not..."
    - Required intervention from test operator
    - Appears as if she was too far away to hear it?

## Level 6 (Trial 3)
- for a little bit in the middle, she seemed startled by one of the obstacles, and then also startled by walking into a wall
- By this point, she showed a good level of competency with navigating the environment she was in

## Level 7 (Trial 4?)
- By this point i'm sure I've lost count of what trial she is on
- While completing this level, she accidentally hit a button which opened up something in windows lmao
    - required tester intervention to fix :|

## Level 8?
- nothing to note that I saw

## New Level (i've given up on counting)
- There was a ball which was unmoving?? 
- She often gets close to a goal, and then backs up before walking into it (why?)

## New level
- She often jumps, I'm assuming from sounds she was not prepared to hear (adjust attenuation?)

# Post-test feedback
1. Skeeter noticed that the partiipant didn't use the mouse a lot, why is that?
    1. The participant found it easier to control with jus the keyboard?
2. Skeeter also noticed that the level 
3. The participant found the "oof" sound startling (did not anticipate it)
4. There was enough time to react to the moving obstacles
5. All of the levels seemed distinct to the participant
