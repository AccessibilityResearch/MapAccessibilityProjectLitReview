# Notes during experiment
- The experiment may be improved by adding a noise of footsteps to indicate the player is moving

## Pretest
- N/A

## Level 1 (tutorial 1)
- This Participant did not use the mouse at all at the very beginning
    - He started using the mouse shortly after I wrote that and then
        - He then stopped using it shortly after I wrote that
            - He started again
                - He stopped again
- The participant is intermittently using the mouse, often not even keeping his phone on it
- This level took a little bit for the participant to navigate initially
- He continually hit the same wall, backed away from it, and then ht it again, about five times
    - It looks like he thought the goal may have been beyond the wall?
- "Oh, this is hard without speech" (He mentioned this several times)
    - Speech cues in the game were desired
    - He got stuck in the tutorial level, after getting one level
- He managed the second goal after about 5 minutes
- He spent a lot of his time in this level close to the wall
- The participant's unfamiliarity with the mouse appeared to make the game a lot harder to him than the previous participant
- The participant routinely navigated to the wrong side of the play area, and found themselves walking into walls repeatedly
- After intervention from the tester, where the controls of the game were clarified to the participant, the participant continued to walk into the wall repeatedly
- The participant is 
- "Most of the time, games for the blind have some kind of speech as a directional component"
- "Normally, I do not use computers without speech"
- Was very explicit about speech component and/or support of screen readers for making it more accessible to the blind
- Level 1 took about 30 minutes

## Level 2 (tutorial 2)
- The participant navigated to two goals within the matter of a few minutes
- Nearly got goal 3 shortly after but narrowly missed it

## Level 3 (tutorial 3)
- The walls continually got in his way, did not like starting near a wall


## Level 4 (Trial 1)


## Level 5 (Trial 2)


## Level 6 (Trial 3)


## Level 7 (Trial 4?)


## Level 8?


## New Level (i've given up on counting)


## New level
